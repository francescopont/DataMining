# DataMining
This repository contains all the project in R at Utrecht University, academic year 2019/2020. "Assignment 1" and "assignment 2" are part of the Data Mining course, "Pattern recognition assignment" is part of the Pattern Recognition course. The Package References folder contains the official documentation of (almost) all the additional packages used in the projects. All project have been developed in Rstudio.

# Assignment 1
The first assignment consists of developing some algorithms to build a classification tree, to perform bootstrap aggregation (bagging) with multiple classification trees, to build a random forest, and some algorithms to employ these models to make predictions. These algorithms are the used to analyse the Eclipse bug data set. The Assignment 1 folder contains the R code, the documented program code ( in .txt and .word format), the text of the assignment, the downloaded data, the reference paper (for more info about the task) and the final report.

# Assignment 2
The second assignment consists of building, performing hyperparameters-tuning and evaluating in total 8 models to analyse hotel reviews collected by Myle Ott and others and, focusing only on the negative reviews, try to discriminate between truthful and deceptive reviews. The models are:
1.  Naive Bayes (generative linear classiﬁer),
2. Regularized logistic regression (discriminative linear classiﬁer),
3. Classiﬁcation trees, (ﬂexible classiﬁer) 
4. Random forests (ﬂexible classiﬁer).
For each of these, we firstly consider only unigrams, and then both unigrams and bigrams. The Assignment 2 folder contains the R code, the text of the assignment, the downloaded data, the reference papers (for more info about the task and benchmark results) and the (corrected) final report( and the images showed in the report).

# Pattern Recognition Assignment
This assignment  consists of building, performing hyperparameters-tuning and evaluating in total 3 models to analyse a data set of handwritten digits and try to determine the digit that was written in the pixel image.
The models are:
1. Regularized multinomial logit model (using the LASSO penalty)
2. Support vector machines
3. Feed-forward neural networks.
The Pattern Recognition Assignment folder contains the R code, a rough documentation of the data set, the final report (and a corrected version), and the images showed in the final report. For more info about the assignment, refer to http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/mpr/project.php.
